## Running the local dev environment
### Start a Jupyter server for notebooks ðŸ““

To spin up a Docker container with Jupyter Notebook libraries installed, run:

```sh
make dev
```

### Download data

The first time collecting data run the following to create the data directory:

```sh
mkdir data
```

To download all data you can run `make get-data` or for individual sets run the following commands.  

#### Car data (for week one homework and week two notebook)

```sh
cd data && mkdir car_data && cd car_data && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv
```

#### New York City Airbnb Open Data (for weeks two and three homework)

```sh
cd data && mkdir airbnb_data && cd airbnb_data && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/AB_NYC_2019.csv
```

#### UCI Student Performance Data (for weeks two homework)

```sh
cd data && mkdir student_performance_data && cd student_performance_data && wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00320/student.zip && unzip student.zip
```

#### Customer churn data

```sh
cd data && mkdir telco_customer_churn && cd telco_customer_churn && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-03-churn-prediction/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
```


## Adding new libraries

Libraries which are currently not available in the Jupyter Notebook should be added to the Dockerfile.
